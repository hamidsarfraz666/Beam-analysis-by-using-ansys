# Beam-analysis-by-using-ansys
A cantilever beam is subjected to a tensile load and is also analyzed for bending. The beam has the following specifications:
•	Applied Load (P): 1000 N, applied along the x-axis (tensile direction)
•	Beam Length (L): 300 mm
•	Beam Cross-Section Radius (R): 15 mm (circular cross-section)
•	Material: Structural Steel
o	Young’s Modulus (E): Use standard value for structural steel
o	Poisson’s Ratio (ν): Use standard value for structural steel

Objectives:
1.	1D Tensile Load Analysis:
o	Find the maximum tensile stress
o	Find the total deformation (elongation)
2.	3D Bending Load Analysis (Cantilever Configuration):
o	Treat the load as applied at the free end, perpendicular to the beam z or -y- axis (for bending)
o	Find the maximum bending stress
o	Find the total deformation (tip deflection)

Expected Results:
Provide numerical values for:
•	Maximum Stress (in MPa or N/mm²)
•	Total Deformation (in mm)
results put the screenshots from static structures to results.
